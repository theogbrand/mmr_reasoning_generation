      "Let's start at the house, which is at the bottom-left (let's call this square (1,1)). The directions are right (→) and up/down (↑/↓) in the grid.",
      "1. → 2: Move right 2 squares from (1,1) → (3,1).\n2. ↓ 2: Move down 2 squares from (3,1) → (3,3).\n3. → 3: Move right 3 squares from (3,3) → (6,3).\n4. ↑ 3: Move up 3 squares from (6,3) → (6,0). However, grids usually start from the top-left as (1,1), so let's check the grid orientation.",
      "Looking at the grid, it seems (1,1) is bottom-left. Let's count from there:\n- Move right 2: land on the square with the green caterpillar (choice C).\n- Move down 2: as there are only three rows, moving down from the bottom row would keep you at the bottom, so the caterpillar is at (3,2).\n- Next, move right 3: land on the square with the butterfly (choice A).\n- Move up 3: go up three squares (likely wraps to the top row), which lands on the bee (choice B).\n- Move right 2: move right, but there is only one more column, so you would stay at the last column (bee).\n- Move up 2: move up, which would keep you at the top row (bee).\nBut this does not match the number of squares. Let's carefully follow each step on the grid:\n1. From the house (bottom-left): right 2 → to the green caterpillar (C).\n2. Down 2: Try to move down, but at the bottom already, so stay on the same square (C).\n3. Right 3: 1 to the right is the frog, 2 to the right is empty, 3 to the right is the snail (D).\n4. Up 3: 1 up is empty, 2 up is ladybird, 3 up is bee (B).\n5. Right 2: 1 to the right is empty, 2 to the right is outside the grid, so stay at bee (B).\n6. Up 2: already at the top, so stay at bee (B).\nBut the path may be intended as starting from (1, bottom row), so let's trace again carefully:\n\n- Start at house (bottom left, call it (1,1))\n- Right 2: (3,1) – green caterpillar (C)\n- Down 2: (3,3) – the squares below caterpillar, but this is a 5x5 grid, so (3,3) is the snail (D)\n- Right 3: (6,3) – off the grid? But grid is only 5x5, so rightmost is (5,3), which is empty.\nSo perhaps each move is within the grid and doesn't go off. Let's trace step by step visually:\n- Start at the house (bottom-left): right 2 steps = 2 squares right, land on the green caterpillar.\n- Down 2: there is only 1 row below, so stay at the bottom row, still on caterpillar.\n- Right 3: move 3 squares right, 1: frog, 2: empty, 3: snail.\n- Up 3: move up 3 rows, 1: empty, 2: empty, 3: bee.\n- Right 2: 1: empty, 2: outside grid (stay at bee).\n- Up 2: already at top, stays at bee.\n\nSo, the ant ends up at the bee, which is answer choice (B)."
