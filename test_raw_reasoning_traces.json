    "[Perception]\n<step_1>\nThe grid in image6 shows several animals placed at specific grid locations, with the ant (from image1) starting at a house (from image2) in the lower left corner of the grid. There are arrows shown for an example path leading to the ladybird (from image3) near the upper right corner.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nThe animals on the grid are: butterfly (upper right), bee (upper left), ladybird (one cell left of butterfly), snail (center), worm (bottom center), frog (bottom right), caterpillar (lower right).\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nThe possible answer options at the bottom (image7) are: (A) butterfly, (B) bee, (C) worm, (D) snail, (E) caterpillar.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThe question asks: Starting at the ant's home (bottom left), follow the arrows: right 2, down 2, right 3, up 3, right 2, up 2. Which animal is reached?\n</step_4>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nDetermine the starting position of the ant: bottom left corner (let's call this (1,1) on a standard grid).\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nApply the steps:\n- Right 2: (1,1) → (3,1)\n- Down 2: (3,1) → (3,3)\n- Right 3: (3,3) → (6,3)\n- Up 3: (6,3) → (6,0) (assuming the grid's y increases downward)\n- Right 2: (6,0) → (8,0)\n- Up 2: (8,0) → (8,-2)\nBut let's check the grid layout and confirm axes.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nLooking closely at the example path, the grid's origin (1,1) is bottom left. Increasing x is right, increasing y is up. So let's try:\n- Start at (1,1).\n- Right 2: (3,1)\n- Down 2: (3,-1) (this would go off-grid; but in the example, down means up the page, so maybe y increases downward).\n- Instead, let's look at the example. The given path for the ladybird (→3, ↑3, →3, ↑1) matches the drawn arrows.\n- Let's count grid rows from bottom left as (1,1), moving right (x) and up (y).\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nBased on the image's arrows, the bottom left is (1,1), rightward is x+, upward is y+. We'll follow the instructions:\n- Start: (1,1)\n- →2: (3,1)\n- ↓2: (3,3)\n- →3: (6,3)\n- ↑3: (6,6)\n- →2: (8,6)\n- ↑2: (8,8)\nNow check which animal is at (8,8).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nCounting the columns and rows in the grid, the top right cell (where the butterfly is) is (8,8).\n</step_5>\n\n<correct_answer>\nThe animal reached is the butterfly, which matches option (A).\nCorrect option: A\n</correct_answer>",
    "[Perception]\n<step_1>\nThe image shows a grid with several animals and a house. The ant starts at the house in the bottom left corner. There are arrows showing possible moves, and animals are placed at various squares.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nThe animals in the grid are (from left to right, top to bottom): a bee, a ladybird, a butterfly, a snail, a green worm, and a frog.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nThe available moves from the house are shown as arrows, but the question asks us to move according to a new sequence: $\\rightarrow 2, \\downarrow 2, \\rightarrow 3, \\uparrow 3, \\rightarrow 2, \\uparrow 2$.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThe answer choices are: (A) butterfly, (B) bee, (C) green worm, (D) snail, (E) frog.\n</step_4>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLet's start at the house, which is at the bottom left corner of the grid.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nMove $\\rightarrow 2$: Move 2 squares right. Now at the third column from the left, still bottom row.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nMove $\\downarrow 2$: Move 2 squares down. But since we are already at the bottom row, this must mean the grid's origin is at the top left, and \"down\" means move up the grid. So, from the bottom row, moving \"down\" 2 squares keeps us at the same row (or perhaps this is a typo and should be \"up\"). Let's check the previous path for reference.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nReviewing the sample path: $\\rightarrow 3, \\uparrow 3, \\rightarrow 3, \\uparrow 1$ gets to the ladybird. Starting from home (bottom left): right 3 (column 4, bottom), up 3 (column 4, row 3 from bottom), right 3 (column 7, row 3 from bottom), up 1 (column 7, row 4 from bottom) — this matches the ladybird's position. So, \"up\" means moving toward the top of the grid, \"down\" means toward the bottom.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nApply moves:\n- Start at (1,1) (bottom-left is (1,1)).\n- $\\rightarrow 2$: (3,1)\n- $\\downarrow 2$: (3,-1) (but can't go lower than row 1, so this must mean something else—perhaps \"down\" is up the grid).\n- Let's invert: (3,1) + $\\downarrow 2$ = (3,3) (move up 2 rows).\n- $\\rightarrow 3$: (6,3)\n- $\\uparrow 3$: (6,0) (can't go above row 1, so must be moving down the grid).\n- From sample, \"up\" increases row number (moves up the grid). Let's assign bottom row as row 1, increasing upward.\n- So, (6,3) + $\\uparrow 3$ = (6,6)\n- $\\rightarrow 2$: (8,6)\n- $\\uparrow 2$: (8,8)\n- But the grid is 7 columns by 7 rows. Let's count grid dimensions.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nThe grid is 7 columns (left to right), 7 rows (bottom to top). Let's number columns 1-7 (left to right), rows 1-7 (bottom to top).\n- Start: (1,1)\n- $\\rightarrow 2$: (3,1)\n- $\\downarrow 2$: (3,3)\n- $\\rightarrow 3$: (6,3)\n- $\\uparrow 3$: (6,6)\n- $\\rightarrow 2$: (7,6) (cannot move beyond 7 columns)\n- $\\uparrow 2$: (7,7) (cannot move beyond 7 rows)\nNow, let's match (7,7) to the animal on the grid.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nThe animal at the top right corner (7,7) is the butterfly.\n</step_7>\n\n<correct_answer>\n(A) Butterfly\n</correct_answer>",
    "[Perception]\n<step_1>\nThe grid in the image contains various animals and a house (the ant's home) in the bottom left corner. The animals present include a butterfly, bee, caterpillar (green worm), snail, frog, and a ladybird.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nThe question asks where the ant ends up after following a sequence of moves starting from the house (bottom-left corner).\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nThe movement instructions are: $\\rightarrow 2, \\downarrow 2, \\rightarrow 3, \\uparrow 3, \\rightarrow 2, \\uparrow 2$.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThe answer choices are: (A) Butterfly, (B) Bee, (C) Caterpillar, (D) Snail, (E) Frog.\n</step_4>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nStart at the house (bottom-left corner of the grid), which is the starting point.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nMove $\\rightarrow 2$: Move 2 squares to the right. Now at the third square from the left in the bottom row (where the green caterpillar is).\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nMove $\\downarrow 2$: Move 2 squares down. However, since we are already at the bottom row, moving down doesn't change the position; we remain at the caterpillar.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nMove $\\rightarrow 3$: Move 3 squares to the right. Now at the sixth square from the left in the bottom row (where the frog is).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nMove $\\uparrow 3$: Move 3 squares up from the frog. Now at the same column (sixth from the left), three rows up. This is an empty square.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nMove $\\rightarrow 2$: Move 2 squares to the right. Now at the eighth column in the same row.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nMove $\\uparrow 2$: Move 2 squares up. Now at the eighth column, two rows higher.\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nCheck which animal is at this final position. Looking at the grid, the caterpillar is at the final destination.\n</step_8>\n\n<correct_answer>\nC\n</correct_answer>",
    "[Perception]\n<step_1>\nThere is a grid with various animals and a house icon. The ant starts at the house in the lower left corner of the grid.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nThe animals on the grid are: bee (top left), ladybird (top right), butterfly (right of ladybird), snail (center), worm (bottom center), frog (bottom right), and ant (bottom left at the house).\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nThe movement instructions are: $\\rightarrow 2$ (right 2), $\\downarrow 2$ (down 2), $\\rightarrow 3$ (right 3), $\\uparrow 3$ (up 3), $\\rightarrow 2$ (right 2), $\\uparrow 2$ (up 2).\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThe answer choices are: (A) Butterfly, (B) Bee, (C) Worm, (D) Snail, (E) Frog.\n</step_4>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nStart at the ant's home (bottom left corner).\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\n$\\rightarrow 2$: Move right 2 squares. The ant is now in the third column from the left, bottom row.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\n$\\downarrow 2$: Move down 2 squares. However, since the ant is already at the bottom row, this move cannot be made; but let's check if the grid origin is at the bottom or the top.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nUpon close inspection, the ant's home is in the second row from the bottom (not the absolute bottom), so moving down 2 squares puts it at the bottom row, third column.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\n$\\rightarrow 3$: Move right 3 squares, now at the sixth column from the left, bottom row (next to the frog).\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\n$\\uparrow 3$: Move up 3 squares, now at the sixth column, third row from the bottom. This is the same row as the butterfly.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\n$\\rightarrow 2$: Move right 2 squares, now at the eighth (rightmost) column, third row from the bottom. This is the butterfly's position.\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\n$\\uparrow 2$: Move up 2 squares, now at the eighth column, fifth row from the bottom, which is the ladybird's position.\n</step_8>\n\n<correct_answer>\nThe ant ends up at the ladybird (which is not an option, but let's check again). \nLet's recount the steps carefully:\n- Start at the house (second row from the bottom, first column).\n- Right 2 (third column).\n- Down 2 (bottom row).\n- Right 3 (sixth column).\n- Up 3 (third row from bottom).\n- Right 2 (eighth column).\n- Up 2 (fifth row from bottom, which is the top row, where the bee is).\n\nSo the ant ends at the bee.\n\nThe correct answer is (B).\n</correct_answer>",
    "[Perception]\n<step_1>\nThe main grid (image6) is a 6x6 board with various animals on different squares. The ant's home is at the bottom left (row 6, column 1) and is marked by an ant and a house.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nThe instructions say: \"When the ant walks from home along the arrows →3, ↑3, →3, ↑1, he gets to the ladybird.\" This sequence is illustrated by the arrows in the image, showing a path from the ant's home to the ladybird (row 2, column 5).\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nThe question asks: \"Which animal does the ant get to when he walks from home along the following arrows: →2, ↓2, →3, ↑3, →2, ↑2?\"\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThe possible answers are shown at the bottom: (A) butterfly, (B) bee, (C) worm, (D) snail, (E) grasshopper.\n</step_4>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nStart at the ant's home: bottom-left corner (row 6, column 1).\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nMove →2: Move 2 columns right to (row 6, column 3).\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nMove ↓2: Move 2 rows down, but already at the bottom row (row 6), so cannot move down further. This suggests \"down\" means toward higher row numbers, but since there are only 6 rows, and the ant starts at the bottom, the move stays at (row 6, column 3).\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nMove →3: Move 3 columns right to (row 6, column 6).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nMove ↑3: Move 3 rows up to (row 3, column 6).\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nMove →2: Attempt to move 2 columns right, but already at the rightmost column (column 6), so remain at (row 3, column 6).\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nMove ↑2: Move 2 rows up to (row 1, column 6).\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nCheck which animal is at (row 1, column 6): It's the bee.\n</step_8>\n<step_9>\nOption (B) corresponds to the bee.\n</step_9>\n\n<correct_answer>\n(B)\n</correct_answer>"
